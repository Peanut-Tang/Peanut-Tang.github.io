            <h3 id="about">Shengtang Huang (黄盛唐)</h3>

            <p>
                My name is Shengtang Huang. I am a senior student majoring in computer  
                science and technology in the 
                <a href="https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">School of the Gifted Young</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">University of Science and Technology of China</a> (USTC). 
                I'm fortunate to be advised by 
                <a href="http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xuechen1989/" target="_blank">Prof. Xue Chen</a>.

            <h3 id="research">Research Interest</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, particularly in areas related to pseudorandomness,
                computational complexity and cryptography. I have conducted research on the design of PRGs, hash functions, and coding.
                At the same time, I am passionate about exploring combinatorics and probability in pure mathematics,
                as well as optimization problems in computational or financial mathematics.
            </p>
